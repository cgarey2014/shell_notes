# Shell Notes

**Shell Notes** is a minimalist Python-based utility that allows you to open an interactive terminal shell session while automatically logging all input and output to a local file. You then have the ability to analyze those logs, through lists and a search function. This tool is ideal for system administrators, educators, and cybersecurity professionals who want to retain an auditable command history.
